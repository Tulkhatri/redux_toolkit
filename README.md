# Redux Toolkit
        Officially recommended approach for writing redux logic.
* Redux > Redux is predictable state container for javascript apps
          it helps you to write application that behave consistently. 
* Action > Change state like delete/ update.
* Reducer> It is a function to determine what a change in state and return new state and
           tell the store how to do finally change state in store.
* state > State is a built-in react object that is used to contain data or 
          information about the components.
* useDispatch > for data transfer model to reducer .
* useSelector > used for data access.
